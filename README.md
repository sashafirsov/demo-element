## Sample
The code
```html
<html-demo-element legend="Error case">
    <slotted-element src="https://badUrl.heck">
        <p slot="loading" hidden>Loading... ‚è≥ </p>
        <p slot="error" hidden>Something went wrong. üò≠ </p>
    </slotted-element>
</html-demo-element>

<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/html-demo-element@1.0.2/html-demo-element.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/slotted-element@1.0.2/slotted-element.js"></script>
```

renders following content:

# Use
If do not want to use template, include the script BEFORE inner content is modified. I.e. immediately after HTML and before scripts with components.

The use of `template` would defer the demo code injection after the source is rendered:
```html
<html-demo-element legend="Error case">
    <template><i>Candle üïØÔ∏è</i></template>
</html-demo-element>
```

When you want to control where the source is located and where to render the code text, use slots:
```html
<html-demo-element>
    <template>ignored</template>
    <template slot="source"> <i>Croissant ü•êÔ∏è </i></template>
    <p><code>slot="source"</code> defines where to get code     </p>

    <p><code>slot="demo"  </code> inject the html from source:  </p>
    <div slot="demo"> replaced with tasty demo </div>

    <p><code>slot="text"  </code> inject colored code text:     </p>
    <div slot="text"> replaced with colored code </div>

</html-demo-element>
```

# API
## Slots
* `source` - the source code node. If omitted it would be taken either from embedded `template` content or
  from embedded into `html-demo-element` dom.
* `text` - placeholder where the highlighted code would be rendered. If omitted the text would be rendered on 
  top of template or top of `html-demo-element` content. 
* `demo` - placeholder where the code would be moved into for displaying live DOM( for HTML type ). 
  If omitted it would be placed beneath of `text` slot 
* `legend` - placeholder where the value of `legend` attribute would be rendered as H3. 
  When omitted, it would be placed on top.

## Properties and attributes
* `source` - the source code text. If the attribute is not defined, it would be initialized from `source` slot ^^
* `type` - one of [prism js  supported languages](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages). 
  `html`, `css`, `js` imported by default. When omitted, assumed `html`.
* `legend` - optional heading for `html-demo-element`
